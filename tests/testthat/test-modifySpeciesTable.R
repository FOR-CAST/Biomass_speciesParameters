## `longevity` is an input to the fit, not a result of it: it picks the factorial curves a species'
## traits are fitted from, those at the grid longevities either side of its own
## (limitToSpeciesLongevity()). Before 3.1.0.9004 modifySpeciesTable() also wrote the AIC-weighted mean
## of those grid longevities over the species' own, so a fitted species ended up with a value between
## its two grid neighbours, or with the grid's largest longevity if it lived longer than that. The
## helper's grid has longevities 150 and 300: the old code gave Abie_las 225 (not 250) and Pice_eng 300
## (not 450).
