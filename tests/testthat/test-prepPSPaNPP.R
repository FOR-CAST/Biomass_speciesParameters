## prepPSPaNPP() keeps a tree if its DBH reaches the larger of `minDBH` and its plot's own recorded
## minimum DBH, PSPplot's `minDBH` column (as PSPclean returns it). Before 3.1.0.9002 the filter ran
## after the join that adds that column, which inside `[` masked the argument: each tree was compared
## with its plot's minimum only, so `minDBH` had no effect (BC plots, which record trees from 2 cm, kept
## them at `minDBH = 9`). 3.1.0.9002 compared each tree with `minDBH` only, so the default `minDBH = 0`
## also kept the trees under their plot's minimum (those of Alberta plots under 9.1 cm, for one).

## plots measured once, each with 10 trees of each DBH class (the forest filter needs >= 30 trees at
## the first measurement): one plot per recorded minimum DBH in `plotMinDBH`, or, if it is NULL, one
## plot and a plot table without the `minDBH` column
